# FlaskrPlus assignment
# Author: Joel Madrigal
# Building upon Mark Liffiton's starter code for "example flask application."
New app features:
Ability to assign a user-provided category and display the posts category underneath it's title.
Ability to filter posts by category so we can view posts only of the chosen category. Users will
be able to select a category from a list without knowing all of the available categories and without
having to use the back button.
Ability to delete posts via a delete button.
